- subtitle: Character partitioning
  desc: >
    See `vignette("char-part")` for a complete workflow that uses these functions to
    conduct automated morphological character partitioning as a pre-processing step
    for clock (time-calibrated) Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of morphological data
    using the programs Mr. Bayes or BEAST2.

- subtitle: Clade membership assignment
  desc: >
    Functions to assign tips to clades based on ancestral nodes. Useful for summarizing
    evolutionary rates by clade in downstream analyses.
  contents:
    - clade_membership

- subtitle: Evolutionary rates & selection mode (MrBayes)
  desc: >
    See `vignette("rates-selection_MrBayes")` for a complete workflow that uses these functions
    to extract evolutionary rate parameters estimated from relaxed clock Bayesian
    inference analyses produced by the program MrBayes and use evolutionary rate
    based inference of selection mode (or strength) adapted to clock-based rates.

- subtitle: Analyzing Trees With Offsets
  desc: >
    See `vignette("offset_handling")` for a complete workflow that uses these functions
    to summarize trees with offsets (with fossil species only) as produced by the SA package in BEAST2.
