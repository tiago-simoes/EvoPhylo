    See `vignette("char-part")` for a complete workflow that uses these functions to
    conduct automated morphological character partitioning as a pre-processing step
    for clock (time-calibrated) Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of morphological data
    using the programs Mr. Bayes or BEAST2.

  desc: >
    See `vignette("rates-selection_MrBayes")` for a complete workflow that uses these functions
    to extract evolutionary rate parameters estimated from relaxed clock Bayesian
    inference analyses produced by the program Mr. Bayes and use evolutionary rate
    based inference of selection mode (or strength) adapted to clock-based rates.
