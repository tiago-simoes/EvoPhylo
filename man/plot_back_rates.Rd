\title{Plots distribution of background rates extracted from posterior log files.}
\usage{
plot_back_rates(
  type = c("MrBayes", "BEAST2"),
  posterior,
  clock = 1,
  trans = c("none", "log", "log10"),
  size = 12,
  quantile = 0.95
)
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{Whether to use data output from "Mr.Bayes" or "BEAST2".}

\item{posterior}{A data frame of posterior parameter estimates (log file).
From Mr.Bayes, it includes a "clockrate" column indicating the mean
(background) clock rate estimate for each generation that will be used for
pairwise t-tests. Such data frame can be imported using
\code{\link[=combine_log]{combine_log()}} (no need to reshape from wide to long). See the
\code{\link{posterior1p}} or \code{\link{posterior3p}} datasets for an
examples of how the input file should look.  From BEAST2, it will include at
least one "rate\if{html}{\out{<filename>}}.mean" column indicating the mean (background)
clock rate estimate for each generation. If there are "P" unlinked clock
partitions in BEAST2, there will be P x "rate\if{html}{\out{<filename>}}.mean" columns (one
for each partition) in the posterior log file.}

\item{clock}{The clock partition number to calculate selection mode. Ignored
if only one clock is available.}

\item{trans}{Type of data transformation to perform on background rates
extracted from the posterior log file from Mr. Bayes or BEAST2. Options
include "none" (if rates are normally distributed), natural log
transformation "log", and log of base 10 transformation "log10".}

\item{size}{Font size for title of plot}

\item{quantile}{Upper limit for X axis (passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2:lims]{ggplot2::xlim()}}) to remove
outliers from histogram. The quantile can be any value between "0" and "1",
but values equal or above "0.95" provide good results in most cases in which
the data distribution is right skewed.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object that can be manipulated using
\pkg{ggplot2} syntax (e.g., to change the theme or labels).
}
\description{
Plots The distribution and mean of background rates extracted from the
posterior log files from Mr. Bayes or BEAST2, as well as the distribution of
background rates if log transformed to test for normality of data
distribution.
}
\details{
Plots The distribution and mean (red dotted line) of background rates
extracted from the posterior log files from Mr. Bayes or BEAST2, as well as
the distribution of background rates if log transformed.  Background rates
should be normally distributed for meeting the assumptions of t-tests and
other tests passed on by downstream functions, including
\code{\link[=get_pwt_rates_MrBayes]{get_pwt_rates_MrBayes()}}, \code{\link[=get_pwt_rates_BEAST2]{get_pwt_rates_BEAST2()}}, and
\code{\link[=plot_treerates_sgn]{plot_treerates_sgn()}}.
