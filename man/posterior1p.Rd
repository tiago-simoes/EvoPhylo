\description{
An example dataset of posterior parameter samples resulting from a
clock-based Bayesian inference analysis using the skyline fossilized
birth–death process (FBD) tree model with Mr. Bayes after combining all
parameter (.p) files into a single data frame with the
\code{\link[=combine_log]{combine_log()}} function. This particular example was produced by
analyzing the data set with a single morphological partition from Simões &
Pierce (2021).
}
\details{
Datasets like this one can be produced from parameter log (.p) files using
\code{\link[=combine_log]{combine_log()}}. The number of variables depends on parameter set
up, but for clock analyses with Mr. Bayes, will typically include the ones
above, possibly also including \code{alpha}, which contains the shape of the
gamma distribution governing how much rates vary across characters. When
using the traditional FBD model rather than the skyline FBD model used to
produce this dataset, there will be only one column for each of
\code{net_speciation}, \code{relative_extinction} and
\code{relative_fossilization}. When using more than one morphological
partition, different columns may be present; see \code{\link{posterior3p}}
for an example with 3 partitions.
