\usage{
FBD_normality_plot(posterior)
}
\arguments{
\item{posterior}{A data frame of posterior parameter estimates containing a
single "Time_bin" column and one column for each FBD parameter value. Such
data frame can be imported using \code{\link[=combine_log]{combine_log()}} followed by
\code{\link[=FBD_reshape]{FBD_reshape()}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object, which can be modified using \pkg{ggplot2}
functions.
}
\description{
Produces plots of the distributions of fossilized birthâ€“death process (FBD)
parameters to facilitate the assessment of the assumptions of normality
within time bins and homogeneity of variance across time bins.
}
\details{
The plots produced include density plots for each parameter within each time
bin (residualized to have a mean of zero), scaled so that the top of the
density is at a value of one (in \emph{black}). Superimposed onto these
densities are the densities of a normal distribution with the same mean and
variance (and scaled by the same amount) (in \emph{red}). Deviations between
the normal density in \emph{red} and the density of the parameters in
\emph{black} indicate deviations from normality. The standard deviation of
each parameter is also displayed for each time bin to facilitate assessing
homogeneity of variance.
