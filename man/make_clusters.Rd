\usage{
make_clusters(dist_mat, k, tsne = FALSE, tsne_dim = 2, tsne_theta = 0, ...)

\method{plot}{cluster_df}(x, seed = NA, nrow = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dist_mat}{A Gower distance matrix, the output of a call to
\code{\link[=get_gower_dist]{get_gower_dist()}}.}

\item{k}{The desired number of clusters (or character partitions), the
output from \code{\link[=get_sil_widths]{get_sil_widths()}}.}

\item{tsne}{Whether to perform Barnes-Hut t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding (tSNE) to produce a multi-dimensional representation of the
distance matrix using \code{Rtsne::Rtsne()}. The number of
dimensions is controlled by the \code{tsne_dim} argument. See Details.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{tsne_dim}{When \code{tsne = TRUE}, the number of dimensions for the
tSNE multidimensional scaling plots. This is passed to the \code{dims}
argument of \code{Rtsne::Rtsne()}. Default is 2.}

\item{tsne_theta}{When \code{tsne = TRUE}, a parameter controlling the
speed/accuracy trade-off (increase for faster but less accurate results).
This is passed to the \code{theta} argument of
\code{Rtsne::Rtsne()}. Default is 0 for exact tSNE.}

\item{\dots}{For \code{make_clusters()}, other arguments passed to
\code{Rtsne::Rtsne()} when \code{tsne = TRUE}.

For \code{plot()}, when plotting a \code{cluster_df} object, other arguments
passed to \code{\link[ggrepel:geom_text_repel]{ggrepel::geom_label_repel()}}
to control display of the observation labels.}

\item{x}{For \code{plot()}, a \code{cluster_df} object; the output of a call
to \code{make_clusters()}.}

\item{seed}{For \code{plot()}, the seed used to control the placement of the
labels and the jittering of the points. Jittering only occurs when
\code{tsne = FALSE} in the call to \code{make_clusters()}. Using a
non-\code{NA} seed ensure replicability across uses.}

\item{nrow}{For \code{plot()}, when \code{tsne = TRUE} in the call to
\code{make_clusters()} and \code{tsne_dim} is greater than 2, the number of
rows used to display the resulting 2-dimensional plots. Default is 1 for
side-by-side plots.}
}
\value{
A data frame, inheriting from class \code{"cluster_df"}, with a row
for each character with its number (\code{character_number}) and cluster
membership (\code{cluster}). When \code{tsne = TRUE}, additional columns
will be included, one for each requested tSNE dimension, labeled
\code{tSNE_Dim1}, \code{tSNE_Dim2}, etc., containing the values on the
dimensions computed using \code{Rtsne()}.

The \code{pam} fit resulting from \code{cluster::pam} is returned in the
\code{"pam.fit"} attribute of the outut object.
}
\description{
Determines cluster (partition) membership for phylogenetic morphological
characters from the supplied Gower distance matrix and requested number of
clusters using partitioning around medoids (PAM, or K-medoids). For further
and independently testing the quality of the chosen partitioning scheme,
users may also poduce graphic clustering (tSNEs), coloring data points
according to PAM clusters, to verify PAM clustering results.
}
\details{
\code{make_clusters()} calls \code{\link[cluster:pam]{cluster::pam()}} on the
supplied Gower distance matrix with the specified number of clusters to
determine cluster membership for each character. PAM is analogous to
K-means, but it has its clusters centered around medoids instead of centered
around centroids, which are less prone to the impact from outliers and
heterogeneous cluster sizes. PAM also has the advantage over k-means of
utilizing Gower distance matrices instead of Euclidean distance matrices
only.

When \code{tsne = TRUE}, a Barnes-Hut t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding is used to compute a multi-dimensional embedding of the distance
matrix, coloring data points according to the PAM-defined clusters, as
estimated by the function \code{make_clusters}. This graphic clustering
allows users to independently test the quality of the chosen partitioning
scheme from PAM, and can help in visualizing the resulting clusters.
\code{Rtsne::Rtsne()} is used to do this. The resulting
dimensions will be included in the output; see Value below.

\code{plot()} plots all morphological characters in a scatterplot with
points colored based on cluster membership. When \code{tsne = TRUE} in the
call to \code{make_clusters()}, the x- and y-axes will correspond to
requested tSNE dimensions. With more than 2 dimensions, several plots will
be produced, one for each pair of tSNE dimensions. These are displayed
together using \code{\link[patchwork:plot_layout]{patchwork::plot_layout()}}.
When \code{tsne = FALSE}, the points will be arrange horizontally by cluster
membership and randomly placed vertically.
}
\note{
When using \code{plot()} on a \code{cluster_df} object, warnings may
appear from \code{ggrepel} saying something along the lines of "unlabeled
data points (too many overlaps). Consider increasing max.overlaps". See \code{\link[ggrepel:geom_text_repel]{ggrepel::geom_label_repel()}} for
details; the \code{max.overlaps} argument can be supplied to \code{plot()}
to increase the maximum number of element overlap in the plot.
Alternatively, users can increase the size of the plot when exporting it, as
it will increase the plot area and reduce the number of elements overlap.
This warning can generally be ignored, though.
